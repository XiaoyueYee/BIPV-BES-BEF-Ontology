# BIPV-BES-BEF Ontology

An ontology for operation and maintenance of combined building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), battery energy storage (BES), and building energy flexibility (BEF) systems.

## Introduction
This dataset introduces a domain ontology named “BIPV-BES-BEF” to integrate BIPV, BES, and BEF O&M data by enriching ontology semantics through relevant standards and leveraging existing ontology resources. This ontology highlights the potential of ontology-based approaches in BIPV, BES, and BEF data integration and knowledge inference. The built ontology can be further applied in the industry, such as additional ontology-based system development, ontology-data models conversion, industry data mapping, etc. 

## Scope
This dataset comprises semantic ontological models designed to model the ​operation and maintenance (O&M) of integrated building energy systems, including:

 - Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV)
 - Battery Energy Storage (BES) System
 - Building Energy Flexibility (BEF) mechanisms

The developed BIPV-BES-BEF ontology comprises 23 main classes that cover weather, general technical conditions, location, district, schedule, fire protection, electrical-related concepts, etc. Three primary classes within such 23 classes represent distinct aspects of BIPV, BES, and BEF domains, providing a hierarchical representation of the concepts associated with BIPV, BES, and BEF systems. Further sub-classes were included within the developed classes and a total of 649 classes and 2359 axioms are included in the ontology. 
The [figure]() folder contains a structural diagram illustrating the ontology's modular hierarchy and relationships between components.

## File Structure
The ontology source code consists of two primary formats:

 - BIPV-BES-BEF Ontology.rdf (RDF/XML format)
 - BIPV-BES-BEF Ontology.ttl (Turtle format)

## Competency question 
The examples of competency questions are shown in [example]() folder. 

## Version Release Information
The initial release of the BIPV-BES-BEF Ontology (v1.0) was published on January 24, 2025. All releases are available for direct download via this folder [GitGub Releases](https://github.com/XiaoyueYee/BIPV-BES-BEF-Ontology). The current development version can be accessed in the main repository folder. 

## Recommended Tools
For ontology visualization, exploration, and editing, we recommend using [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/), an industry-standard ontology development environment.
